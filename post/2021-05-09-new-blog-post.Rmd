Here are a few quick tips about using Python in R Studio. 

This next chunk shows how R and python code can be used together in R studio using the reticulate package:

R code:
```{r}
library(reticulate)
hello<- "Python"
```
Python code:
```{python}
world = "is fun and easy"
print(r.hello,world)
```
You can also use Python as a calculator, just like you can with R. In python, values are assigned with "=" rather than an arrow "<-". 

```{python}
this = 2000
year = 21
this + year
```
